# What I’d add with +2 hours
1. Post-processor: sentence splitter + FKGL ≤ 3.0 enforcement and easy-word glossary (“glisten (shine softly)”).
2. Memory of child prefs (favorite animal/colors) and category-specific style knobs (lullaby cadence, repetitive soothing refrains).
3. FastAPI + Streamlit UI with textbox for feedback, a score badge, and optional TTS (OpenAI or local).
4. A/B judge (two judges with slightly different rubrics) and aggregate scores for more robust gating.
5. Unit tests for JSON extract/validate and unsafe filter.
